### Experience <a name='experience'></a>

Verizon Wireless
:**2012--Present:** *Software Developer*  
Primary responsibilities include being the Subject Matter Expert in the integration of “Click to Call/Chat” functionality to service-oriented desktop and mobile pages. This has granted me hands-on experience with **Object-Oriented Programming**, and the usage of web technologies such as **Java/J2EE, HTML, CSS, jQuery and JavaScript**. Some of the related projects have required me to become familiar with Content Management Systems such as **Adobe CQ5**. In addition, I regularly guide other developers and project leads in their own implementations and troubleshooting of “Click to Chat/Call” for sales-oriented pages. Such collaboration allows me to strengthen my communication skills on a daily basis.  
Chat session analytics and transcript search are my other areas of focus. I’ve been of assistance in the design and implementation of **Hadoop-based** solutions to Verizon Wireless’ reporting needs. Covering the creation of **Oozie workflows** for *data ingestion* in **Hive/HBase**, and *data indexing* through a **SOLR/HBase** combination. Proficiency with **UNIX-based tools and systems** has been necessary for properly testing and delivering projects. I’m also currently involved in the creation of Hadoop data extracts and reports for various internal applications. For this I have been leveraging open-source **ETL** tools such as Apache’s Pig to deliver highly distributed and scalable solutions to business needs.
